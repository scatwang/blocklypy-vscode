# Compile and Run Your Program

Once you have a Python program and a connected device, you're ready to run your
code!

## Running Your Program

### Quick Run - Press F5

The fastest way to run your program:

1. Open your Python file
2. Press **F5** (or click the Run button)
3. The program compiles and uploads to your hub
4. Execution starts automatically

### Alternative Methods

- Click the **▶ Compile and Run** button in the editor toolbar
- Use the Command Palette: `BlocklyPy Commander: Compile and Run`
- Right-click in the editor and select **Compile and Run**

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Compilation**: Your Python code is compiled to MicroPython bytecode (.mpy)
2. **Upload**: The compiled program is transferred to your hub
3. **Execution**: The program runs immediately on the device
4. **Output**: Console output appears in the Terminal

## Program Control

- **Stop Program**: Press **F6** or **Shift+F5** to stop a running program
- **Compile Only**: Press **Shift+Ctrl+F5** to compile without running

## Console Output

Watch the integrated terminal for:

- Print statements from your program
- Error messages and stack traces
- Hub status information
